Huff is a low-level programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Huff does not hide the inner workings of the EVM. Instead, Huff exposes its programming stack to the developer for manual manipulation.

Initially developed by the [Aztec Protocol](https://github.com/AztecProtocol) team, Huff was created to write [Weierstrudel](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/weierstrudel), an on-chain elliptical curve arithmetic library that requires incredibly optimized code which neither Solidity nor Yul could provide.

[Huff](https://github.com/huff-language/huffc) was later rewritten by [Jet Jadeja](https://twitter.com/JetJadeja) in Typescript, and is [currently being rewritten again in Rust](https://github.com/huff-language/huff-rs).

Huff can be used to write highly-efficient smart contracts for use in production, or it can serve as a way for beginners to learn more about the EVM.
