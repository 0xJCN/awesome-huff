## What the heck is Huff?

Huff is a low-level programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Huff does not hide the inner workings of the EVM. Instead, Huff exposes its programming stack and provides useful tools like constants and macros.

Initially developed by the [Aztec Protocol](https://github.com/AztecProtocol) team, Huff was created to write [Weierstrudel](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/weierstrudel), an on-chain elliptical curve arithmetic library that requires incredibly optimized code which neither Solidity nor Yul could provide. [Huff](https://github.com/huff-language/huffc) was later rewritten by [Jet Jadeja](https://twitter.com/JetJadeja) in Typescript, and finally [it has been rewritten in Rust](https://github.com/huff-language/huff-rs) as `huff-rs` which is the version we use today.

Huff can be used to write highly-efficient smart contracts for use in production, or it can serve as a way for beginners to learn more about the EVM.
